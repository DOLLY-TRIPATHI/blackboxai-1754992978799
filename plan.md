# Detailed Implementation Plan for "Prema ki Rasoi" Website

## Overview
We will build a modern, responsive website for the restaurant "Prema ki Rasoi" using Next.js and React components. The site will feature a hero banner, navigation header, and clearly segmented menu sections with recipes grouped by category. The design emphasizes clean typography, ample white space, and consistent color schemes while using only internal placeholder images when needed.

## File Changes and Component Implementations

### 1. Homepage (src/app/page.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Serve as the main entry point and landing page.
- **Steps:**
  - **Imports:** Bring in the Header component from `src/components/Header.tsx` and the MenuSection component from `src/components/MenuSection.tsx`.
  - **Hero Section:**  
    - Add a hero section that includes a large `<img>` tag.  
    - Set the `src` to  
      `https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Modern+minimalist+landing+page+for+restaurant+Prema+ki+Rasoi`  
      and provide a highly descriptive `alt` text (e.g., "Modern minimalist landing page showing a vibrant restaurant ambiance for Prema ki Rasoi").  
    - Implement an `onError` handler that changes the `src` to a fallback URL (e.g., `https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Fallback+image+for+restaurant+Prema+ki+Rasoi`).
  - **Menu Sections:**  
    - Define four arrays for recipe items:
      - **Breakfast Recipes:** ["Poha", "Halwa", "Sabudana khichdi", "Fried daliya", "Chawmin", "Chole bhature", "Poori sabji", "Paratha sabji", "Aloo Paratha", "Pasta", "Sweet corn", "Sabudana paratha"]
      - **Main Courses:** ["Dal tadka", "Dal fried", "Jeera rice", "Butter roti", "Roti", "Paneer", "Green seasonal sabji", "Chole"]
      - **Curry & Veg Specials:** ["Aloo tmatar", "Kofta", "Veg kofta", "Kadhi", "Mix veg", "Kadhai paneer"]
      - **Sweet Desserts:** ["Sweet", "Kheer", "Halwa", "Laddu"]
    - Render each category using the MenuSection component, passing the title and corresponding items.
  - **Overall Layout:**  
    - Wrap the header, hero, and menu sections within semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` if needed).
    - Ensure proper spacing and a responsive layout.

### 2. Header Component (src/components/Header.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Provide a consistent navigation header at the top of the site.
- **Steps:**
  - Create a functional React component with a `<header>` element.
  - Add a prominent restaurant title "Prema ki Rasoi" and a navigation menu.
  - Include navigation links using Next.jsâ€™s Link component for "Home", "Menu", "About Us", and "Contact" with clean text styling.
  - Ensure the header is styled with modern typography, proper spacing, and a responsive design.

### 3. MenuSection Component (src/components/MenuSection.tsx)
- **Purpose:** Display each recipe category with its respective items.
- **Steps:**
  - Create a reusable component that accepts props:  
    - `title` (string) for the section header.
    - `items` (string array) for the recipe list.
  - Render the title in an `<h2>` element followed by an unordered list (`<ul>`) where each recipe is an `<li>`.
  - **Error Handling:**  
    - Check if the `items` array is empty; if so, display a message like "No items available" to inform users.
  - Use modern styling via CSS classes to ensure a uniform look with clear visual hierarchy.

### 4. Global CSS Updates (src/app/globals.css)
- **Purpose:** Establish consistent visual styling and ensure responsiveness.
- **Steps:**
  - Add or update styles for the header, hero section, and menu sections.  
    - Define fonts, padding, margins, and colors to achieve a modern, minimalist design.
  - Create classes for image responsiveness and error fallback styling.
  - Ensure spacing and layout adjustments enhance both desktop and mobile views.
  - Validate that the hero image and text elements maintain their structure even if an image fails to load.

## Additional Considerations
- **Error Handling:**  
  - For the hero image, implement an inline `onError` event to set a fallback image.
  - Validate that each MenuSection receives a non-empty array and handle empty cases gracefully.
- **UI/UX:**  
  - The navigation menu is simple and accessible, promoting ease of use.  
  - Recipe sections are clearly demarcated with descriptive headings and list items for clear user navigation.
  - The overall design uses internal placeholder images only in the hero/banner section to maintain visual impact without external dependencies.

## Summary
- Created the homepage in `src/app/page.tsx` with a hero banner and categorized recipe sections.  
- Implemented a `Header` component in `src/components/Header.tsx` for navigation.  
- Developed a reusable `MenuSection` component in `src/components/MenuSection.tsx` to list recipes with error handling.  
- Updated global styles in `src/app/globals.css` for a modern, responsive look.  
- Ensured all images use placeholder URLs with descriptive alt texts and graceful onError fallbacks.  
- The plan emphasizes clear UI/UX, consistent typography, and proper error handling.  
- All changes adhere to best practices and integrate smoothly with the existing Next.js codebase.
